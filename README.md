# Menu-Driven-Programe
This is a menu-driven program created by using C language.In this case, we have used "switch-case". We have 10 user defined functions which are called from the switch case. This code is written by using the concepts of C language such as loops, arrays, functions, etc.
There are 11 funtions used in this programe.
1st funtions is used to exit from its running status. We can call it using zero "0". This is achived by using return statement.
2nd function is used to find the volume to the cylinder whose radius and height is given by the user. This function is called by entering "1".
3rd function is responsible for printing the marksheet of the students. The information and the data is given by the user which is used to make the marksheet for students. This funtion is called by entering "2".
4th function can print the pyramid pattern up to a particular numbers of line given by the user. Called by entering "3".
5th function helps to reverse the string contaning the space gap as well. We can use this by pressing "4".
6th function is used to swap two given numbers by user,called by entering "5". 
7th function is created by using the bubble sorting concept which can arrange the elements of an array in ascending or descending order. Called using "6" character.
8th function can judge whether the given year is leap year or not.
9th function can find the sum of the digits given by the user.
10th function is used to find the area of the circle in float datatype upto two decimal places. Use this function by entering "10".
This programe keeps running until the exit function is called. Or by simply closing the compiler.
we have used do-while loop for this.
